# Among Us
This application is inspired by my current favorite game, "Among Us". In the Among Us community, there are stereotypes for each colors and they are described right in my app. In the homescreen, the user can scroll to a desired color and then tap on the character for a description of the common ideas that the color character would do in a game of Among Us.
